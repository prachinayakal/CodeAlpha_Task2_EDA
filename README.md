# 📊 Task 2: Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
Performed Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) to understand the dataset's structure, identify key patterns and anomalies, and validate assumptions using statistical methods and visualizations. This helped uncover insights and potential issues for further analysis.

## ✅ Objective  
To understand the structure and characteristics of a dataset by exploring data types, distributions, relationships, and potential issues, enabling deeper insights for further analysis.

## 🛠️ Tools & Technologies  
- Python  
- Pandas  
- Matplotlib  
- Seaborn  
- NumPy  
- Jupyter Notebook

## 📌 Key Deliverables  
- Summary statistics and variable descriptions  
- Visualizations such as histograms, box plots, scatter plots, and correlation matrices  
- Identification of missing values, outliers, and data inconsistencies  
- Initial assumptions and insights to guide modeling

## 🔍 Highlights  
- Asked relevant questions to guide analysis  
- Explored the structure and data types of each feature  
- Detected trends, correlations, and anomalies using plots  
- Applied descriptive statistics to support hypothesis testing

## 📁 Files Included  
- `eda_analysis.ipynb` – Jupyter Notebook with code, plots, and insights  
- `dataset.csv` – Dataset used for EDA  
- `plots/` – Folder containing exported image files of visualizations

## 📈 Sample Insights  
- Feature distributions and central tendencies  
- Relationships between key variables  
- Presence of missing or extreme values  
- Early hypotheses for further modeling

## 🧠 Outcome  
This task highlights a structured approach to understanding a dataset and lays a strong foundation for machine learning or further statistical modeling.
